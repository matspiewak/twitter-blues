# twitter-blues
Chrome extension to distinguish "blue verify" from the default one.

This extension replaces blue verification badge (looking exactly the same as the "normal" one!) with the blue OMEGALUL emote

-- Wouldn't care less about current Twitter(X), so you can count this repo as a dead one. --
